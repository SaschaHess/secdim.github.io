          <h2>Our journey has started way back...</h2>
          <p>For many years,
              We did lots of penetration testing (white-box or black-box)
              for many companies, from medium size startups to Fortune 500.
              <strong>
                  We realised more often that our pen-test reports do not
              solve these firms security problem. 
              </strong>
              In fact their biggest
              security problem was not related to the design nor implementation
              of their programs. The root cause was something else.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>A wrong culture and approach to security that did not
                  encourage their engineering teams to actively look into
                  eliminating security bugs.
              </strong>
              Instead they see
              the security bug reports as an additional burden to deal with.
              A work item that often stopped them to go to prod and
              this made them even more upset.
          </p>
          <p>
             Well, clearly this was not right and if we don't get
             engineers on-board, our security problems would have
             gotten worse.
          </p>
          <h2>We changed our approach</h2>
          <p>
              We worked with our customers to solve these issues. 
              We first listen to their concerns from the product owner to
              software testers.
          </p>
          <p>
              We soon find out how much we, the security crowd, did not understand them and 
              there is a big gap between what we push for and what they care.
              We worked to get this addressed through security awareness 
              sessions, internal hack-your-software events and Capture The Flag.
          </p>
          <h2>Our training courses emerged</h2>
          <p>
              We put together real pen-test findings into a
              training course. Examples were taken from the programs
              that developers themselves had developed.
              <strong> 
              We did not made another security course to turn
              every developer to a penetration tester!
              </strong>
              Instead we designed a course that teaches
              <strong>
                  defensive design-patterns and security principles
              </strong>
              . Our course talked the developer's language and gave them
              first-hand experience to feel the severity of security
              vulnerabilities in their own program.
          </p>
          <h2>We had amazing results</h2>
          <p>
              We received excellent feedback. Developers were able to
              use their learnings in their day-to-day work.
              <strong>
              They loved the fact that our course helped them 
              to develop a better designed software and security
              is implicitly taken care of. ❤️
              </strong>
          </p>
           <p>
              The cultural transformation were so awesome that after each
              training courses, the internal security team received
              notification of security bugs discovered by engineers and patched!
           </p>
          <h2>So we created SecDim</h2>
          <p>
              We want more companies share these success stories and
              we love to help them to change their culture and approach
              to application security.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>
                  We've created a dedicated company for security education.
              </strong>
          </p>
